# CCNLab
All the source code files for CCN Software Lab are pushed to this repository. If you find any problem or want to modify any source code, feel free to do that. All source codes have been compiled using GCC 5.1.1 with C++11 standard, therefore, there is high chance that these wouldn't compile successfully on CCN Lab's 19th century "Solaris" operating system. Please modify accordingly, specially Experiment 4 and Experiment 5. Don't forget to use -lsocket, -lnsl, -lm, and -lpthread flags while compiling. For poission and pareto simulation experiment, gnuplot is required to be installed on computer to generate the plots. If you don't have it, please comment out the last few lines in the source codes. After compiling, always run the server program first, then run the client program.
